      {}. The Google groups and Github are public to everyone. The Discord is
      open to everyone, but you can not read the conversations if you are not on
      the server. For this reason, we created a new section on the website that
      logs all the chats in Discord. This way, we are all in sync! If none of
      these three options fits you, please, email us at:
