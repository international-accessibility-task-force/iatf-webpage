        International Accessibility Task Force is an open-to-everyone community
        of: assistive technology users, open-source developers, and people
        interested in accessibility and inclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this community, users and developers work as a team. The assistive
        technology users can request to code a tool to the developers, and
        developers might create a workgroup to develop an open-source solution
        to fulfill the request.
      </p>

      <h3>We have three principles:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Be kind to yourself and others.</li>
        <li>Only one project at once (applies to all users).</li>
        <li>Only code under GPL License (applies to all developers)</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Purpose of the principles:</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and should treat others
          the same way.
        </li>
        <li>
          We would love for the requested projects to end in a final product
          that all the community can use for free. This rule prevents a user
          start several projects without finishing them first.
        </li>
        <li>
          We want to promote accessible open-source projects, and the GPL
          license guarantees that our projects are for all the community, free
          to use.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        We use discord to communicate between members. Discord is an accessible,
        friendly place to chat on the internet. If you would like to join our
        Discord server and join the cause, you might use the following link: {}
