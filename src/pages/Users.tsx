      <h2>IATF Users</h2>
      <p>
        The IATF Users are a crucial part of the IATF project. If you want to be
        an IATF user, you must use assistive technologies in your daily tasks.
        For instance, a screen reader. IATF users are, ideally: users with
        blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement,
        speech disabilities, photosensitivity, cognitive limitations, elders,
        and combinations of these. If you are not if none of these groups, but
        you use assistive technologies in your daily tasks, you might be a good
        fit.
