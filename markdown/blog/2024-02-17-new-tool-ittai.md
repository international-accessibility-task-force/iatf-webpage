### Empowering Accessibility with ITTAI

We are thrilled to introduce ITTAI, a groundbreaking tool that leverages artificial intelligence to enhance web accessibility. ITTAI is designed to support users with visual impairments by providing detailed descriptions of images, making digital content more accessible and inclusive.

#### Why ITTAI?

In today's digital age, visual content dominates the web, creating barriers for those unable to see them. ITTAI addresses this challenge by offering an innovative solution: transforming images into words. Whether it's navigating websites or exploring digital media, ITTAI ensures that everyone can participate fully in our digital world.

#### How ITTAI Works

ITTAI uses advanced AI algorithms to analyze images and generate accurate, descriptive text. This means users can receive a textual representation of visual content, bridging the gap between visual information and accessibility.
