The assistive technology users can ask for help from developers, and developers might create a workgroup to develop an open-source solution to fulfill the request. </p> <h3>We have three principles:</h3> <ol> <li>Be kind to yourself and others.</li> <li>Only one project at once (applies to all users).</li> <li>Only code under GPL License (applies to all developers)</li> </ol> <h3>Purpose of the principles:</h3> <ol> <li>Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and should treat others the same way.</li> <li> We would love for the requested projects to end in a final product that all the community can use for free. This rule prevents a user start several projects without finishing them first. </li> <li> We want to promote accessible open-source projects, and the GPL license guarantees that our projects are for all the community, free to use. </li> </ol> <p> We use discord to communicate between members. Discord is an accessible, friendly place to chat on the internet.
